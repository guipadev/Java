        //Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

        // Single-line Comments
        //Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

        //Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).

        //This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

        // This is a comment
        System.out.println("Hello World");

        // This example uses a single-line comment at the end of a line of code:
        System.out.println("Hello World"); // This is a comment
